            <h2>Functions</h2>
			<p>So far, you have learned how to create variables, write text and data to the screen, receive input from the user, make decisions based on data held in variables, and loop
				code based on a condition. And, in truth, this is tha majority of all you really need to write any program you want in C++ (the other useful thing to have is the ability to make arrays,
				which we will discuss shortly) -- these features are what makes C++ <span class="italic">Turing complete</span>, or capable of solving any problem a computer can solve.
				But the problem is that writing more advanced programs than the ones you have seen so far are incredibly difficult without the use of more higher-level programming language features
				(i.e. those that create arbitrary constructs and translate them into). So, the first such construct we will look at is a function.</p>
			<p>A function in programming is not too different from a function that you might use in algebra. It takes in an input and spits out an output by doing something to that input.
				However, functions in programming can do a lot more than what we typically use them for in math. To elaborate:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A function can take any number of inputs, or no inputs at all</li>
				<li>The inputs of a function can be of any data type (including <code>string</code>!), and they need not all be the same</li>
				<li>A function can "return" (output) any data type (including <code>string</code>!), or return nothing at all</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In programming, we typically use functions to avoid writing repetitive code, as well as to organize our code. If we find ourselves writing the same code (or very similar code) several times
				over and over again, we begin setting ourselves up for failure: if one of those instances of that code fails, we have to spend lots of time trying to find it and debug it; if
				<span class="italic">all</span> of the instances fail, we have to spend time debugging and fixing <span class="italic">every single one of them</span>, and it can be hard to distinguish
				one instance from another. Functions provide a handy interface for us to <span class="italic">abstract</span> code like this and use it quickly elsewhere in the code, without much hassle.
				The added benefit is if the function is wrong, or needs to be improved, and you fix or improve that function, <span class="underline">all other code that uses that function is fixed or
				improved without you doing anything else</span>. Being able to understand and write code using such abstractions is highly valued when writing large software projects.</p>

			<h3 id="code-snippets">A quick note</h3>
			<p>Thus far, almost all of the example code that you have seen has been complete -- it has all the appropriate <code>#include</code> statements, has <code>using namespace std</code> at the top,
				defines a function <code>main</code> and has <code>return 0</code> at the end. As we learn more programming constructs, writing out the full program will become excessively long at points,
				so instead, many of the code snippets here will be fragments of the full source, which demonstrate only the code we're discussing.
				There will still be full-length example programs where they are necessary to demonstrate a concept,
				but it is expected that you will be able to understand where the example code belongs in the overall source file.</p>
			<h3 id="basics">Function basics</h3>
			<p>As it turns out, you have already seen what a function looks like:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
int main () {
	//some code...
	
	return 0;
}</pre>
			<p><code>main</code> is an example of a function. Let's examine a little more closely what all of this means:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">int main ()</pre>
			<p>Here, we are defining a function called <code>main</code> that outputs (returns) an <code>int</code> and takes no input parameters (the empty parentheses).
				This description is known as a function's <span class="italic">signature</span>, or the aspects of a function that uniquely identify it:  name, return type, and parameters.
				The reason that we always define this function is because it is your program's <span class="italic">entry point</span> -- the operating system starts your program by calling
				its <code>main</code> function.</p>
			<p>OK, let's look at the other function-related line in the code:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">return 0;</pre>
			<p>This is <code>main</code>'s <span class="italic">return statement</span>, which is how <code>main</code> tells the computer what its "output" is
				(or, using math terms, what <code>main</code> "evaluates to"). The <code>0</code> is the <code>main</code>'s <span class="italic">return value</span>, which is the value
				that <code>main</code> will evaluate to. The type of a function's return value must <span class="underline">always</span> match its return type (in this case, <code>int</code>, as in <code>int main</code>), otherwise it will
				not compile (this is under the same principle that you cannot store values of a differing data type in a variable).</p>
			<p>Functions neither need to have the <code>int</code> return type, nor return the value <code>0</code>
				(0 is actually just a <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html" target="_blank">message to the operating system</a> to tell it if the program had any execution errors). You can return any
				data type, such as <code>double</code>, <code>bool</code>, <code>string</code>, or even one of your own, when we learn abstract data types.</p>
			<p>Generally speaking, a function looks like this:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
returnType functionName (inputParameterList) {
	//code
	return value;
}</pre>
			<p>Let's expand the idea of a function just by starting with a regular algebra function: f(x) = x<sup>2</sup>. Let's implement this as a function in C++:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
double f (double x) {
	return x * x;
}</pre>
			<p>Now, we've changed some things from before: instead of returning an <code>int</code>, we now return a <code>double</code>; and instead of taking no parameters,
				we now have one: <code>x</code>, which is a <code>double</code>. Inside the function, <code>x</code> is just a regular variable with type <code>double</code>, and we can use it
				just like we would any other variable. Note that we did not have to declare it in the function body -- because we gave the variable a type and a name in the parameter list,
				the compiler knows all it needs to make a regular variable from that alone.</p>
			<p class="italic">For those wondering: We wrote <code>x * x</code> because <code>^</code> is <span class="underline">not</span> exponentiation in C++
				(<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/operators/#bitwise" target="_blank">it's actually bitwise XOR</a>). There is a function in the <code>cmath</code>
				header file (<code>#include &lt;cmath&gt;</code>) called <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/pow/" target="_blank"><code>pow</code></a>
				that computes arbitrary powers, but it is actually faster in terms of runtime to just multiply a number by itself than it is to call <code>pow(x, 2)</code>.</p>
			<p>So, now we have written a function for f, but how do we use it? Let's go back to our <code>main</code>:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
int main () {
	double a;
	
	cout &lt;&lt; "Please input a number: ";
	cin >> a;
	
	cout &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; "^2 = " &lt;&lt; f(a) &lt;&lt; endl;
	
	return 0;
}</pre>
			<p class="output">Please input a number: <span class="input">5</span><br/>5^2 = 25</p>
			<p>This is called a <span class="italic">function call</span>. A function call is exactly like you would expect -- the name of the function, followed by the inputs you are passing to it in parentheses.
				When execution reaches this point, the program calls that function with its input <code>x</code> set to the value of <code>a</code>; <code>f</code> then executes its body until its return statement
				is reached. When <code>f</code> returns, control returns to <code>main</code>, where the function call evaluates to the return value of <code>f</code> (in this case, 25). <code>cout</code> sees the
				value <code>25</code>, and thus prints <code>25</code> to the screen.</p>
			<p>Now, let's do a little more with functions, something more akin to what you might do in a program:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
string guessMyNumber (int a, int b) {
	string msg;
	int sum = a + b;
	
	if (sum >= 52 || sum &lt= 32)
		msg = "That is very far from my number.";
	else
		msg = "That is close to my number!";
		
	return msg;
}

int main () {
	int num1, num2;
	string result;
	
	cout &lt;&lt; "Input two integers to be summed: ";
	cin >> num1 >> num2;
	
	result = guessMyNumber(num1, num2);
	
	cout &lt;&lt; result &lt;&lt; endl;
	return 0;
}</pre>
			<p class="output">Input two integers to be summed: <span class="input">648 8964</span><br/>That is very far from my number.</p>
			<p>Note that we now have multiple input parameters -- we separate these by inserting a comma between each parameter. When you call a function with multiple parameters,
				order matters -- so, in this example, <code>num1</code> is passed to <code>guessMyNumber</code> as <code>a</code>, and <code>num2</code> is passed as <code>b</code>.
				If we instead wrote <code>guessMyNumber(num2, num1)</code>, then <code>a</code> would have the same value as <code>num2</code>, and <code>b</code> would have the same
				value as <code>num1</code>. If we only called <code>guessMyNumber</code> with one input (say, <code>guessMyNumber(num1)</code>), then the compiler would error out when
				you try to compile, as <code>guessMyNumber</code> expects two inputs. The same thing would happen if you called it with three or more inputs.</p>
			<p>Just like we do in <code>main</code>, we can use any lanuage constructs we have learned so far -- variables, <code>if-else</code> statements, loops -- in other functions as well.
				Here, we return a string that indicates whether the user input two numbers that sum close to 42.</p>
			<p>Note that, just because <code>guessMyNumber</code> is defined before <code>main</code>, <code>main</code> still executes first (recall that <code>main</code> is the entry point for your program).
				The program will ask the user for two integers, then passes them to <code>guessMyNumber</code>, which sums the integers and uses the result and stores a message in a string named <code>msg</code>,
				which is then returned back to <code>main</code>. <code>main</code> then stores the message in a variable named <code>result</code>, which is subsequently printed to the screen.</p>
				
			<h4 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h4>
			<p>In the last example above, you may have noticed that <code>guessMyNumber</code> was defined before <code>main</code>. Why is that?</p>
			<p>C++ compilers are only required to know about things that exist in the source before any particular line. You <span class="italic">could</span>
				define <code>guessMyNumber</code> after <code>main</code>, except it may not compile -- the compiler might think that <code>guessMyNumber</code> doesn't exist
				because it simply hasn't reached it yet.</p>
			<p>That said, we usually want to make <code>main</code> the first actual code in our file, since this is where execution begins, and we don't want to go digging for
				<code>main</code> in a file full of functions. How do we fix this problem?</p>
			<p>The answer: you <span class="italic">prototype</span> your functions. Prototyping basically tells the compiler that a function with a particular signature does exist, but it does
				not actually define the function (that is done later). Let's rewrite the above example, but with a function prototype:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp; highlight: [2]">
//This is the prototype
string guessMyNumber (int a, int b);

int main () {
	int num1, num2;
	string result;
	
	cout &lt;&lt; "Input two integers to be summed: ";
	cin >> num1 >> num2;
	
	result = guessMyNumber(num1, num2);
	
	cout &lt;&lt; result &lt;&lt; endl;
	return 0;
}

//This is the definition
string guessMyNumber (int a, int b) {
	string msg;
	int sum = a + b;
	
	if (sum >= 52 || sum &lt= 32)
		msg = "That is very far from my number.";
	else
		msg = "That is close to my number!";
		
	return msg;
}</pre>
			<p>Now, you'll notice that the prototype and the first line of the function definition are almost identical
				-- they both have the same format, listing the function's return type, name, and parameters, except the
				prototype ends with a semicolon (instead of an opening curly brace).
				This has allowed us to move the definition of <code>guessMyNumber</code> after <code>main</code>.</p>
			<p>You can prototype and define any number of functions in the same file; it is recommended that you use the following format when writing source code with functions:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
//any #includes here
using namespace std; //if necessary

//All of your function prototypes go here. Do not prototype main.

int main () {
	//code...
	
	return 0;
}

//All of the prototyped functions are defined here.</pre>
			<p class="italic">Why not prototype <code>main</code>? The entire purpose of prototyping was to make <code>main</code> the first function that is defined in the source file.
				You could prototype <code>main</code>, but it's pointless -- <code>main</code> is defined before anything else, so there is no dependency issue here.</p>
			
			<h4 id="basics-activity">Activity</h4>
			<p>Write the following programs with one or more function(s). Be sure to prototype any functions other than <code>main</code> that you write.</p>
