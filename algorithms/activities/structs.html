            <h2>Abstract data types, part 1: <code>struct</code>s</h2>
			<p><span class="italic">Object-oriented programming</span> is, in essence, the one feature that C++ is known for, and the facilities
				that C++ provides to that end are very powerful. Essentially, object-oriented programming allows you to group both data and code
				into one unit in your code (an "object") at a high level. In fact, you have already encountered pre-built objects in your code --
				<code>cin</code>, <code>cout</code>, <code>string</code>s, and <code>vector</code>s are all examples of objects built
				using C++'s object-oriented programming paradigm. In this activity, we will explore some of the basic features that object-oriented
				programming has to offer us, using a new language feature: a <code>struct</code>.</p>
			<p><code>struct</code>s (and, later, <code>class</code>es) allow us to create our own data types.
				First, we use them to define both the <code>behavior</code> and the <code>state</code> of our data types.
				From there, we can instantiate these data types as variables ("objects") in our program, taking advantage of the fact that
				these variables/objects can take care of their own state requirements by themselves, which allows us to write our code
				in a much more conceptual manner.</p>
			<p>In this lesson:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#data">Member data</a></li>
				<li><a href="#functions">Member functions</a></li>
				<li><a href="#constructors">Constructors</a></li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="data">Member data</h3>
			<p>As we proceed through this activity, we will be working to design a <code>struct</code> called <code>Student</code>,
				which handles all of the records for one particular student in a class. This <code>struct</code> will have a lot of requirements, so
				we're going to build <code>Student</code> incrementally.</p>
			<p>Let's start by just looking at how to create a <code>struct</code>:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp; highlight: [1,2,3,7]">
struct Student {
	//...
};

int main () {
	//create two Student variables called 'alice' and 'bob' 
	Student alice, bob;
	
	//...
	return 0;
}</pre>
			<p>So far, we see that there are two places where we are dealing with <code>Student</code>: on lines 1 through 3 where we define the <code>struct</code>,
				and then on line 7 where we declare two <code>Student</code> variables named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_bob" target="_blank"><code>alice</code> and <code>bob</code></a>.
				After that, we would presumably interact with <code>alice</code> and <code>bob</code> to handle student records, but let's focus on the <code>struct</code> definition first.</p>
			<p>First, note that the <code>struct</code> definition is <span class="italic">outside</span> the definition for <code>main</code>. While this isn't strictly necessary, doing so makes your
				<code>struct</code> visible to all of the functions in your file, which is typically what you want.</p>
			<p>The first thing we are going to want to do is add the data for our <code>Student</code>: likely their first and last name, their age, their grade level,
				and their current score in the class (which we will measure as a decimal ranging from 0 to 100):</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp;">
struct Student {
	string firstName;
	string lastName;
	int age;
	int gradeLevel;
	double score;
};</pre>
			<p>This is fairly straightforward: for all of the data we want <code>Student</code> to retain, we simply declare a variable for each piece of data,
				using the appropriate data type. These variables are called <span class="italic">member variables</span>, in that they are all members of the
				<code>Student</code> <code>struct</code>.</p>
			<p>Member variables are a little different from the variables you have interacted with so far, for a few reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The declarations in the <code>struct</code> definition <span class="italic">don't actually set aside any memory for those variables</span>.
					The declarations are really just notes to the compiler that say "I will need these variables when the programmer wants to create an object of this type".</li>
				<li><span class="underline">Member variables are unique to each instance of <code>Student</code></span>. In the example above, <span class="italic">both
					<code>alice</code> and <code>bob</code> will have their own unique <code>firstName</code>, <code>lastName</code>, <code>age</code>, etc. member variables.</span>
					Changing the member variables of <code>bob</code> will have no effect on the members of <code>alice</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It can easily be seen that the first point is a side effect of the second: because each member variable must be unique to each instantiation of the <code>struct</code>,
				we cannot set aside any memory for them until a <code>Student</code> is declared.</p>
			<p>So, we know how to tell the compiler what the member variables of a <code>struct</code> are, but how do we use them in our code? Well, we know that each member variable
				is attached to a specific instance of <code>Student</code>, so let's try to do something with our <code>Student</code>s <code>alice</code> and <code>bob</code>:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
int main () {
	Student alice, bob;
	
	alice.firstName = "Alice";
	alice.lastName = "Zircon";
	alice.age = 16;
	alice.gradeLevel = 11;
	alice.score = 98.4;
	
	bob.firstName = "Bob";
	bob.lastName = "Ytterby";
	bob.age = 14;
	bob.gradeLevel = 9;
	bob.score = 93.5;
	
	if (alice.score > 96.0) {
		cout &lt;&lt; "Alice has an A+" &lt;&lt; endl;
	} else {
		cout &lt;&lt; "Alice does not have an A+" &lt;&lt; endl;
	}
	
	cout &lt;&lt; "Bob is in " &lt;&lt; bob.gradeLevel &lt;&lt; "th grade" &lt;&lt; endl;
	
	return 0;
}</pre>
			<p>As we see above, we can access the member variables of <code>alice</code> and <code>bob</code> using the
				<code>.</code> or <span class="italic">member-of</span> operator. We use the variable name for the object,
				and then following the member-of operator, we type the name of the member variable we want to access.
				From there, we can use the member variable just like we would use any other variable.</p>
			<p class="italic">Note: You've seen the member-of operator before, with <code>vector</code>: <code>vec.size()</code>,
				<code>vec.push_back()</code>, <code>vec.resize()</code>, etc.</p>
			<h4 id="data-activity">Activity</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Extend the <code>Student</code> <code>struct</code> to also store gender (a single <code>char</code> such as <code>M</code> or <code>F</code>)
					and their street address (a <code>string</code>).</li>
				<li>Write a program that gets all of the information in <code>Student</code> on 5 students, and then outputs each student's first and last name, their grade level,
					and their letter grade. Use an array or a <code>vector</code> to store the students. Use the following scale to compute the letter grade:
					<ul>
						<li>93+: A</li>
						<li>[90, 93): A-</li>
						<li>[87, 90): B+</li>
						<li>[83, 87): B</li>
						<li>[80, 83): B-</li>
						<li>[77, 80): C++</li>
						<li>[73, 77): C</li>
						<li>[70, 73): C-</li>
						<li>[67, 70): D+</li>
						<li>[63, 67): D</li>
						<li>[60, 63): D-</li>
						<li>[0, 60): E</li>
					</ul>
				</li> 
			</ul>
			<h3 id="functions">Member functions</h3>
			<p>So, we've seen that we can use a <code>struct</code> to store abitrary, related data in one "varaible".
				Our <code>Student</code> <code>struct</code> can tell us information about the student's name, gender, address,
				age, grade level, and current score in the class. However, as you saw in the activity, it still comes short;
				it takes a lot of work to convert some of this information into other usable formats, which may be more suited
				to certain tasks.</p>
			<p>In the case of the activity, we could just add another member variable that stores the letter grade, but that adds a bunch more problems.
				We have to update the letter grade every time we update the score; and if we update the letter grade first, what score do we choose?
				Also, aren't we storing the data in multiple locations? Isn't that something we want to avoid?</p>
			<p>The answer to all of this is that we can have <span class="italic">member functions</span> in addition to member variables.
				Just as with member variables, these functions are associated with a specific instance of the <code>Student</code> struct,
				and we can use them to do all sorts of useful things. You will be writing the member function implementation of the letter grade
				determination algorithm in the activity at the end of this section, so let's focus on a similar, but slightly different task:
				how do we get the colloquial name of their grade level? Let's implement this as a member function:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
struct Student {
	string firstName;
	string lastName;
	int age;
	int gradeLevel;
	double score;
	
	string className () {
		if (gradeLevel == 9) return "freshman";
		else if (gradeLevel == 10) return "sophomore";
		else if (gradeLevel == 11) return "junior";
		else if (gradeLevel == 12) return "senior";
		
		//For grades &lt; 9, just return an empty string
		return "";
	}
};</pre> 
			<p>First, we notice that the function definition is <span class="italic">inside</span> the definition for <code>Student</code>.
				This is to be expected, as it is a member of <code>Student</code>, just like the member variables.</p>
			<p>But the more interesting thing: we can just start using the <code>gradeLevel</code> variable without declaring it or taking it as a parameter!
				That is because the compiler automatically makes all member variables available to member functions, so we don't need to declare them twice.
				However, if our member function needed to use more variables, you would still have to declare those variables in the function.
				Any variables declared as such are <span class="italic">not</span> member variables, as they will disappear after the function returns.</p>
			<p>Like regular functions, member functions can take parameters to get data from external sources.
				This is useful if you want to update the state of the <code>struct</code> without breaking some restriction. For example:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
struct Student {
	string firstName;
	string lastName;
	int age;
	int gradeLevel;
	double score;
	
	//...
	
	//Create a function to set the score so that student's cannot have scores
	//less than 0 or greater than 100
	void setScore (double newScore) {
		if (newScore >= 0 && newScore &lt;= 100) score = newScore;
		
		//otherwise, do nothing
	}
};</pre>
			<p>Once we have member functions written, we can access them just like we would member variables:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
cout &lt;&lt; alice.className() &lt;&lt; endl; //"junior"

alice.setScore(68.9);
cout &lt;&lt; alice.score &lt;&lt; endl; //68.9

bob.setScore(250);
cout &lt;&lt; bob.score &lt;&lt; endl; //93.5</pre>

			<h4 id="function-prototyping">Prototyping member functions</h4>
			<p>Wait, if the function has to be defined inside the <code>struct</code> definition, then doesn't that put a function definition before <code>main</code>?
				In order for <code>main</code> and any other function to know about <code>Student</code>, it must be defined before each of those functions.
				Like before, we can use function prototyping to move all of the function implementation after <code>main</code>, so <code>main</code> is the first
				function implementation that we see. There is the added benefit of prototyping functions in a <code>struct</code> as moving the code elsewhere allows
				us to quickly glance at what members the <code>struct</code> has.</p>
			<p>Prototyping member functions is very similar to prototyping regular functions, except there is one big difference in the syntax:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp; highlight: [11, 19]">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

struct Student {
	string firstName;
	string lastName;
	int age;
	int gradeLevel;
	double score;
	
	string className ();
};

int main () {
	//...
}

//Note the "Student::" before the function name
string Student::className () {
	if (gradeLevel == 9) return "freshman";
	else if (gradeLevel == 10) return "sophomore";
	else if (gradeLevel == 11) return "junior";
	else if (gradeLevel == 12) return "senior";
	
	return "";
}</pre>
			<p>We can see that the prototype itself is the same: just the function signature, followed by a semicolon; but the prototype
				<span class="italic">must be in the <code>struct</code> defintion</span>. The bigger difference is when we implement the function:
				our function name has <code>Student::</code> prefixed to it. Because we are no longer in the initial <code>struct</code> definition,
				we have to tell the compiler that the <code>className</code> is a member of <code>Student</code>.
				Just like before, we can use the members of <code>Student</code> without declaring them or taking them as parameters; the compiler
				takes care of that for us.</p>
			
			<h4 id="functions-activity">Activity</h4>
			<p>Rewrite your code for the last activity so the letter grade is returned from a member function.
				Also, write a member function to set a <code>Student</code>'s <code>gradeLevel</code> such that the <code>gradeLevel</code>
				is never negative nor greater than 12 (we will assume that a <code>gradeLevel</code> of 0 is for kindergarten).</p>
			
			<h3 id="constructors">Constructors</h3>
			<p>We have seen the most basic uses of <code>struct</code>s -- we can use them to store related data on a particular item,
				and we can write functions to perform operations on that data. But so far, we've had to manually initialize all of the
				data by hand. This can be very tedious, especially if we have several <code>struct</code>s that we need to initialize.
				Constructors allow us to create default initialization processes that run automatically. As we will see, we can also
				customize constructors so we can modify the initialization process when necessary.</p>
			<p>A constructor is, at its core, a function; however it is a little different from all of the other functions we have seen so far.
				Let's look at an example:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp; highlight: [8]">
struct Student {
	string firstName;
	string lastName;
	int age;
	int gradeLevel;
	double score;
	
	Student () {
		//Initialization code goes here
	}
};</pre>
			<p>The two major things to point out here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="italic">The constructor has no return type, not even <code>void</code>.</li>
				<li>The constructor has the same exact name as the <code>struct</code>'s type. This is name case-sensitive.</li> 
			</ul>
			<p>We can now put our initialization code in the constructor:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
struct Student {
	string firstName;
	string lastName;
	int age;
	int gradeLevel;
	double score;
	
	Student () {
		age = 14; //reasonable defaults?
		gradeLevel = 9;
		score = 0;
	}
};</pre>
			<p>Now, whenever we declare a variable of type <code>Student</code>,
				the initialization code in the constructor will run on our newly declared variable,
				and all of the member variables will be initialized to the value specified in the constructor:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
int main () {
	Student student; //constructor runs here
	
	cout &lt;&lt; student.age &lt;&lt; endl;
	cout &lt;&lt; student.gradeLevel &lt;&lt; endl;
	cout &lt;&lt; student.score &lt;&lt; endl;
	
	return 0; 
}</pre>
			<p class="output">14<br/>9<br/>0</p>
			<p>As with regular member functions, we can also prototype constructors. The format is the same, just remember that constructor has no return type.</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
struct Student {
	string firstName;
	string lastName;
	int age;
	int gradeLevel;
	double score;
	
	Student ();
};

int main () {
	//...
}

Student::Student () {
	//initialization code here
}</pre>
			<p>But what if we wanted to pass in different initial values?
				We can accomplish this using a constructor, by passing in parameters:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
struct Student {
	string firstName;
	string lastName;
	int age;
	int gradeLevel;
	double score;
	
	Student (const string &amp;firstIn, const string &amp;lastIn) {
		firstName = firstIn;
		lastName = lastIn;
		age = 14;
		gradeLevel = 9;
		score = 0;
	}
};

int main () {
	//We pass the parameters at declare time, like a function call.
	Student student ("John", "Doe");
	
	cout &lt;&lt; student.firstName &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; student.lastName &lt;&lt; endl;
	
	return 0;
}</pre>
			<p class="output">John Doe</p>
			<p>This way, whenever we create a <code>Student</code> object, we can give it an initial name off the bat.
				We could change the parameters the constructor takes in to include the student's age, grade, and so on.
				These types of constructors are called <span class="italic">custom constructors</span>, and constructors
				that take no parameters are called <span class="italic">default constructors</span>.
				However, there are a few caveats you need to consider:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="bold">Constructor parameters should never have the same name as any member variables</span>.
					While this is technically valid, it causes <a href="scoping-style.html">scoping</a> issues and is very likely to cause headaches.</li>
				<li>If you write a default constructor, <span class="bold">do not</span> place empty parentheses after variable declarations for that type
					(i.e. do <span class="underline">not</span> write <code>Student student ();</code>). It is syntactically incorrect C++.</li>
				<li>If you write a custom constructor, <span class="italic">all</span> declarations of that type <span class="italic">must</span>
					specify those parameters at declaration time (except as noted below).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's look at the last caveat listed above: if you create a custom constructor, all declarations of that <code>struct</code> must pass values for that constructor;
				in other words, the default constructor is not defined for <code>struct</code>s that have a custom constructor.</p>
			<p>But then why were we able to declare <code>struct</code> variables without having defined any constructors at all?
				The reason is because the compiler creates a default constructor for you if you don't define any constructor(s) for a <code>struct</code>.
				However, as soon as you define a constructor, the compiler no longer creates the default constructor;
				at that point it is up to you to define a default constructor. As we are about to see, there are ways to give a <code>struct</code> both a custom constructor
				and a default constructor.</p>
			<h4 id="default-parameters">Default parameters</h4>
			<p>The first method is to define <span class="italic">default parameters</span>. Default parameters are default values that are assigned to function parameters
				if the caller does not pass any value for that parameter. You can define default parameters like so:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp; highlight: [5]">
struct Student {
	//...
	
	//Make the name blank by default
	Student (const string &amp;firstIn="", const string &amp;lastIn="") {
		firstName = firstIn;
		lastName = lastIn;
		age = 14;
		gradeLevel = 9;
		score = 0;
	}
};

int main () {
	//Now, you can treat the custom constructor like a default constructor
	Student student1;
	Student student2 ("John", "Doe");
	
	//Outputs a single space
	cout &lt;&lt; student1.firstName &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; student1.lastName &lt;&lt; endl;
	
	cout &lt;&lt; student2.firstName &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; student2.lastName &lt;&lt; endl;
	
	return 0;
}</pre>
			<p class="output">&nbsp;<br/>John Doe</p>
			<p>You can use default parameters with prototypes, as well. Define the default parameters in the prototype, <span class="italic">but not the definition</span>:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp; highlight: [4, 18]">
struct Student {
	//...
	
	Student (const string &amp;firstIn="", const string &amp;lastIn="");
};

int main () {
	//Treat the custom constructor like a default constructor
	Student student;
	
	//Outputs a single space
	cout &lt;&lt; student.firstName &lt;&lt; ' ' &lt;&lt; student.lastName &lt;&lt; endl;
	
	return 0;
}

//No default parameters here!
Student::Student (const string &amp;firstIn, const string &amp;lastIn) {
	firstName = firstIn;
	lastName = lastIn;
	age = 14;
	gradeLevel = 9;
	score = 0;
}</pre>
			<p>However, there is one catch to using default parameters:
				<span class="bold">all parameters following a parameter with a default value must also have default values</span>.
				In other words, a constructor like this is <span class="underline">not</span> allowed:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">Student (const string &amp;firstIn="", const string &amp;lastIn); //WRONG: no default for lastIn!</pre>
			<h4 id="constructor-overloading">Constructor overloading</h4>
			<p>Default parameters are the easy method to make a <code>struct</code> have both a default constructor and a custom constructor, however,
				it is somewhat restrictive in what you can do with it. The other method, which is what is normally used to solve this problem,
				is to use a C++ feature called <span class="italic">function overloading</span> to define a separate custom and default constructors.
				The advantage to this method is it allows you to have multiple different custom constructors for the same object.</p>
			<p>Before we look and see how to overload a constructor, let's step back to functions for a moment. Recall that a function begins with a line that looks like this:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">returnType functionName (paramType param1, ...);</pre>
			<p>This is called the function's <span class="italic">signature</span>. Using the information provided in this line, a function can be uniquely identified by the compiler.</p>
			<p>Now, suppose we have the following function signature:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">int myFunc (int a);</pre>
			<p>We can identify it as a function called <code>myFunc</code> that takes a single <code>int</code> as a parameter and returns an <code>int</code>.
				But what happens if we were to define another function with the following signature in the same file?</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">int myFunc (int a, double b);</pre>
			<p>It has the same name as our first function, but it has a different number of parameters, so it has a different signature than the first function.
				Because of this, the compiler has a way to distinguish the following two function calls:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
myFunc(3);
myFunc(2, 4.5);</pre>
			<p>The program will call our original function on the first call, and the new function on the second, even though they have the same name!
				Because the compiler was able to tell that the first function call had only 1 parameter passed to it,
				and that the second function call had 2 parameters passed to it (the second of which is a <code>double</code>), it was able to correctly
				identify the right function to call, because we <span class="italic">overloaded</span> the function name <code>myFunc</code>
				with distinct function signatures. Functions that share the same name but have different signatures are called <span class="italic">overloaded functions</span>,
				or <span class="italic">overloads</span> for short.</p>
			<p>Function overloads don't even need to have a different number of arguments, even just one parameter having a different type is enough
				for the compiler to create a valid overload:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
int myFunc (int a);
int myFunc (string input);</pre>
			<p>Based on the type of the variable you pass to the function, the compiler can determine which overload to call.</p>
			<p>Overloaded functions can even have different return types:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
int myFunc (int a);
string myFunc (string input);</pre>
			<p>The only catch regarding return types is that <span class="italic">at least one parameter must be different from all of the other overloads of that name</span>.
				It is not enough to simply change the return type of the function (even though it is technically a different function signature),
				because the return value can be ignored, so the compiler would not always have all the information it needs to properly identify the right overload to call.</p>
			<p>Since a constructor is a function, we can overload it too!</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">

			<p class="output">&nbsp;<br/>John Doe</p>
			<p>The big advantage here is that we don't have to stop here.
				We could define further overloads to create multiple custom constructors:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
struct Student {
	//...
	
	Student ();
	Student (const string &amp;firstIn, const string &amp;lastIn);
	Student (const stirng &amp;firstIn, const string &amp;lastIn, int age, int gradeLevel);
}

//...</pre>
			<p>While overloading constructors is incredibly useful, keep in mind that
				<span class="underline">you can only call one constructor for any given <code>struct</code> when you declare the object</span>.
				You cannot call other constructor overloads from within one constructor.</p>
				
			<h4 id="constructors-activity">Activity</h4>
			<p>Using your code from the last activity, write in a default constructor and at least one custom constructor that allows you to set
				the name of the student, their age, and their grade level.</p>
