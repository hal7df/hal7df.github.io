            <h2>Abstract data types, part 1: <code>struct</code>s</h2>
			<p><span class="italic">Object-oriented programming</span> is, in essence, the one feature that C++ is known for, and the facilities
				that C++ provides to that end are very powerful. Essentially, object-oriented programming allows you to group both data and code
				into one unit in your code (an "object") at a high level. In fact, you have already encountered pre-built objects in your code --
				<code>cin</code>, <code>cout</code>, <code>string</code>s, and <code>vector</code>s are all examples of objects built
				using C++'s object-oriented programming paradigm. In this activity, we will explore some of the basic features that object-oriented
				programming has to offer us, using a new language feature: a <code>struct</code>.</p>
			<p><code>struct</code>s (and, later, <code>class</code>es) allow us to create our own data types.
				First, we use them to define both the <code>behavior</code> and the <code>state</code> of our data types.
				From there, we can instantiate these data types as variables ("objects") in our program, taking advantage of the fact that
				these variables/objects can take care of their own state requirements by themselves, which allows us to write our code
				in a much more conceptual manner.</p>
			<p>In this lesson:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#data">Member data</a></li>
				<li><a href="#functions">Member functions</a></li>
				<li><a href="#constructors">Constructors</a></li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="data">Member data</h3>
			<p>As we proceed through this activity, we will be working to design a <code>struct</code> called <code>Student</code>,
				which handles all of the records for one particular student in a class. This <code>struct</code> will have a lot of requirements, so
				we're going to build <code>Student</code> incrementally.</p>
			<p>Let's start by just looking at how to create a <code>struct</code>:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp; highlight: [1,2,3,7]">
struct Student {
	//...
};

int main () {
	//create two Student variables called 'alice' and 'bob' 
	Student alice, bob;
	
	//...
	return 0;
}</pre>
			<p>So far, we see that there are two places where we are dealing with <code>Student</code>: on lines 1 through 3 where we define the <code>struct</code>,
				and then on line 7 where we declare two <code>Student</code> variables named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_bob" target="_blank"><code>alice</code> and <code>bob</code></a>.
				After that, we would presumably interact with <code>alice</code> and <code>bob</code> to handle student records, but let's focus on the <code>struct</code> definition first.</p>
			<p>First, note that the <code>struct</code> definition is <span class="italic">outside</span> the definition for <code>main</code>. While this isn't strictly necessary, doing so makes your
				<code>struct</code> visible to all of the functions in your file, which is typically what you want.</p>
			<p>The first thing we are going to want to do is add the data for our <code>Student</code>: likely their first and last name, their age, their grade level,
				and their current score in the class (which we will measure as a decimal ranging from 0 to 100):</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp;">
struct Student {
	string firstName;
	string lastName;
	int age;
	int gradeLevel;
	double score;
};</pre>
			<p>This is fairly straightforward: for all of the data we want <code>Student</code> to retain, we simply declare a variable for each piece of data,
				using the appropriate data type. These variables are called <span class="italic">member variables</span>, in that they are all members of the
				<code>Student</code> <code>struct</code>.</p>
			<p>Member variables are a little different from the variables you have interacted with so far, for a few reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The declarations in the <code>struct</code> definition <span class="italic">don't actually set aside any memory for those variables</span>.
					The declarations are really just notes to the compiler that say "I will need these variables when the programmer wants to create an object of this type".</li>
				<li><span class="underline">Member variables are unique to each instance of <code>Student</code></span>. In the example above, <span class="italic">both
					<code>alice</code> and <code>bob</code> will have their own unique <code>firstName</code>, <code>lastName</code>, <code>age</code>, etc. member variables.</span>
					Changing the member variables of <code>bob</code> will have no effect on the members of <code>alice</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It can easily be seen that the first point is a side effect of the second: because each member variable must be unique to each instantiation of the <code>struct</code>,
				we cannot set aside any memory for them until a <code>Student</code> is declared.</p>
			<p>So, we know how to tell the compiler what the member variables of a <code>struct</code> are, but how do we use them in our code? Well, we know that each member variable
				is attached to a specific instance of <code>Student</code>, so let's try to do something with our <code>Student</code>s <code>alice</code> and <code>bob</code>:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
int main () {
	Student alice, bob;
	
	alice.firstName = "Alice";
	alice.lastName = "Zircon";
	alice.age = 16;
	alice.gradeLevel = 11;
	alice.score = 98.4;
	
	bob.firstName = "Bob";
	bob.lastName = "Ytterby";
	bob.age = 14;
	bob.gradeLevel = 9;
	bob.score = 93.5;
	
	if (alice.score > 96.0) {
		cout &lt;&lt; "Alice has an A+" &lt;&lt; endl;
	} else {
		cout &lt;&lt; "Alice does not have an A+" &lt;&lt; endl;
	}
	
	cout &lt;&lt; "Bob is in " &lt;&lt; bob.gradeLevel &lt;&lt; "th grade" &lt;&lt; endl;
	
	return 0;
}</pre>
			<p>As we see above, we can access the member variables of <code>alice</code> and <code>bob</code> using the
				<code>.</code> or <span class="italic">member-of</span> operator. We use the variable name for the object,
				and then following the member-of operator, we type the name of the member variable we want to access.
				From there, we can use the member variable just like we would use any other variable.</p>
			<p class="italic">Note: You've seen the member-of operator before, with <code>vector</code>: <code>vec.size()</code>,
				<code>vec.push_back()</code>, <code>vec.resize()</code>, etc.</p>
			<h4 id="data-activity">Activity</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Extend the <code>Student</code> <code>struct</code> to also store gender (a single <code>char</code> such as <code>M</code> or <code>F</code>)
					and their street address (a <code>string</code>).</li>
				<li>Write a program that gets all of the information in <code>Student</code> on 5 students, and then outputs each student's first and last name, their grade level,
					and their letter grade. Use an array or a <code>vector</code> to store the students. Use the following scale to compute the letter grade:
					<ul>
						<li>93+: A</li>
						<li>[90, 93): A-</li>
						<li>[87, 90): B+</li>
						<li>[83, 87): B</li>
						<li>[80, 83): B-</li>
						<li>[77, 80): C++</li>
						<li>[73, 77): C</li>
						<li>[70, 73): C-</li>
						<li>[67, 70): D+</li>
						<li>[63, 67): D</li>
						<li>[60, 63): D-</li>
						<li>[0, 60): E</li>
					</ul>
				</li> 
			</ul>
			<h3 id="functions">Member functions</h3>
			<p>So, we've seen that we can use a <code>struct</code> to store abitrary, related data in one "varaible".
				Our <code>Student</code> <code>struct</code> can tell us information about the student's name, gender, address,
				age, grade level, and current score in the class. However, as you saw in the activity, it still comes short;
				it takes a lot of work to convert some of this information into other usable formats, which may be more suited
				to certain tasks.</p>
			<p>In the case of the activity, we could just add another member variable that stores the letter grade, but that adds a bunch more problems.
				We have to update the letter grade every time we update the score; and if we update the letter grade first, what score do we choose?
				Also, aren't we storing the data in multiple locations? Isn't that something we want to avoid?</p>
			<p>The answer to all of this is that we can have <span class="italic">member functions</span> in addition to member variables.
				Just as with member variables, these functions are associated with a specific instance of the <code>Student</code> struct,
				and we can use them to do all sorts of useful things. You will be writing the member function implementation of the letter grade
				determination algorithm in the activity at the end of this section, so let's focus on a similar, but slightly different task:
				how do we get the colloquial name of their grade level? Let's implement this as a member function:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
struct Student {
	string firstName;
	string lastName;
	int age;
	int gradeLevel;
	double score;
	
	string className () {
		if (gradeLevel == 9) return "freshman";
		else if (gradeLevel == 10) return "sophomore";
		else if (gradeLevel == 11) return "junior";
		else if (gradeLevel == 12) return "senior";
		
		//For grades &lt; 9, just return an empty string
		return "";
	}
};</pre> 
			<p>First, we notice that the function definition is <span class="italic">inside</span> the definition for <code>Student</code>.
				This is to be expected, as it is a member of <code>Student</code>, just like the member variables.</p>
			<p>But the more interesting thing: we can just start using the <code>gradeLevel</code> variable without declaring it or taking it as a parameter!
				That is because the compiler automatically makes all member variables available to member functions, so we don't need to declare them twice.
				However, if our member function needed to use more variables, you would still have to declare those variables in the function.
				Any variables declared as such are <span class="italic">not</span> member variables, as they will disappear after the function returns.</p>
			<p>Like regular functions, member functions can take parameters to get data from external sources.
				This is useful if you want to update the state of the <code>struct</code> without breaking some restriction. For example:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
struct Student {
	string firstName;
	string lastName;
	int age;
	int gradeLevel;
	double score;
	
	//...
	
	//Create a function to set the score so that student's cannot have scores
	//less than 0 or greater than 100
	void setScore (double newScore) {
		if (newScore >= 0 && newScore &lt;= 100) score = newScore;
		
		//otherwise, do nothing
	}
};</pre>
			<p>Once we have member functions written, we can access them just like we would member variables:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp">
cout &lt;&lt; alice.className() &lt;&lt; endl; //"junior"

alice.setScore(68.9);
cout &lt;&lt; alice.score &lt;&lt; endl; //68.9

bob.setScore(250);
cout &lt;&lt; bob.score &lt;&lt; endl; //93.5</pre>

			<h4 id="function-prototyping">Prototyping member functions</h4>
			<p>Wait, if the function has to be defined inside the <code>struct</code> definition, then doesn't that put a function definition before <code>main</code>?
				In order for <code>main</code> and any other function to know about <code>Student</code>, it must be defined before each of those functions.
				Like before, we can use function prototyping to move all of the function implementation after <code>main</code>, so <code>main</code> is the first
				function implementation that we see. There is the added benefit of prototyping functions in a <code>struct</code> as moving the code elsewhere allows
				us to quickly glance at what members the <code>struct</code> has.</p>
			<p>Prototyping member functions is very similar to prototyping regular functions, except there is one big difference in the syntax:</p>
			<pre class="brush: cpp; highlight: [11, 19]">
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

struct Student {
	string firstName;
	string lastName;
	int age;
	int gradeLevel;
	double score;
	
	string className ();
};

int main () {
	//...
}

//Note the "Student::" before the function name
string Student::className () {
	if (gradeLevel == 9) return "freshman";
	else if (gradeLevel == 10) return "sophomore";
	else if (gradeLevel == 11) return "junior";
	else if (gradeLevel == 12) return "senior";
	
	return "";
}</pre>
			<p>We can see that the prototype itself is the same: just the function signature, followed by a semicolon; but the prototype
				<span class="italic">must be in the <code>struct</code> defintion</span>. The bigger difference is when we implement the function:
				our function name has <code>Student::</code> prefixed to it. Because we are no longer in the initial <code>struct</code> definition,
				we have to tell the compiler that the <code>className</code> is a member of <code>Student</code>.
				Just like before, we can use the members of <code>Student</code> without declaring them or taking them as parameters; the compiler
				takes care of that for us.</p>
			
			<h4 id="functions-activity">Activity</h4>
			<p>Rewrite your code for the last activity so the letter grade is returned from a member function.
				Also, write a member function to set a <code>Student</code>'s <code>gradeLevel</code> such that the <code>gradeLevel</code>
				is never negative nor greater than 12 (we will assume that a <code>gradeLevel</code> of 0 is for kindergarten).</p>
